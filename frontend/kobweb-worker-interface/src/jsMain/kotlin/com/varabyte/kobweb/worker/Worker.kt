/**
 * Interface for a Kobweb worker.
 *
 * This is the API for a worker from the outside-in. That is, it is the view of a worker from the application's
 * point of view, where it submits work to the worker and then waits for a response. (This is in contrast to the
 * `WorkerStrategy` class, which is the view of a worker from the inside-out).
 *
 * The Kobweb Worker Gradle plugin implements this interface. See that module (and WorkerProcessor.kt) for more details.
 *
 * Normally, users are not expected to interact with this interface directly; rather, they should work directly with the
 * generated worker implementation. However, by extracting this interface, we can provide utility methods that work with
 * any worker implementation.
