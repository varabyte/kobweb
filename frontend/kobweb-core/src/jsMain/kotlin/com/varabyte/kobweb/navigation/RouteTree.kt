            // Backwards compatibility hack. For the longest time, Kobweb's router was designed to be unaware of the
            // site prefix, and code that called it was responsible for prepending it, for example like so:
            // `ctx.router.tryRoutingTo(BasePath.prepend("/")`.
            // However, we've seen casees where new users were surprised by this behavior -- that `Link("/")` works but
            // `ctx.router.tryRoutingTo("/")` doesn't. In fact, even as a veteran Kobweb developer myself, I found I
            // would have not assumed this to be the case.
            // So I decided to update the Router code to auto-prepend the base path if set. However, this means that
            // some projects in the wild could break. So, here, we try to detect the case where both a user and Kobweb
            // prepending the base path each, and if so, fall back to a valid route (but emit a warning).
